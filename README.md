## About The Project

Since I found it difficult to find a good WebSocket client that only uses html and only receives messages, I implemented this. The main purpose is to implement a client for [Korabli-chatrans](https://github.com/Yusux/Korabli-chatrans).

## Getting Started

The css and javascript files are in the css and js folders respectively. The html file is in the root folder named `index.html`. Just open the html file in a browser and you are good to go.

### Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
2. Click the config button on the top right corner to open the configuration modal.
3. Input the server address and port in the input fields.
4. Click the `Connect` button to connect to the server.
5. If the connection is successful, the modal will close after about 2 seconds and the messages will start to appear in the message box.
